function Send-GitBranch {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Pushes commits from the current git branch to its remote repository.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The `Send-GitBranch` function sends all commits on the current branch of the
    local Git repository to its upstream remote repository. If you are pushing a
    new branch, use the `SetUpstream` switch to ensure Git tracks the new remote
    branch as a copy of the local branch.

    If the repository requires authentication, pass the username/password via
    the `Credential` parameter.

    This function implements the `git push` command.

    .EXAMPLE
    Send-GitBranch

    Pushes commits from the repository at the current location to its upstream
    remote repository

    .EXAMPLE
    Send-GitBranch -RepoRoot 'C:\Build\TestGitRepo' -Credential $PsCredential

    Pushes commits from the repository located at 'C:\Build\TestGitRepo' to its
    remote using authentication
